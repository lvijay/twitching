Twitching
=========

Twitching is a simple emacs twitter client to get tweets
from a user's followers.

History
-------

Twitching was written with two primary goals in mind:

1. Get tweets from all followed users without losing any.

2. The ability to filter some tweets from the timeline.

Features
--------

1. Periodically download your timeline and show them in a
buffer.

2. Favorite tweets.

3. Navigate easily through your tweets, use Emacs's `C-s`
and `C-r` to quickly find tweets.

4. Filters -- probably the best feature of twitching.  If
you're really irritated that all your tweets have something
annoying like `#RoyalWedding`, set up a filter that will
remove all tweets with that hashtag and you're twitter feed
is clean.  These are persistent so future tweets will also
be filtered away.

5. Remove -- Same as filters but these aren't persistent.
It just removes tweets that match the filter criteria from
the current list of tweets.

6. Group -- This provides a way to show all your tweets
ordered by the tweeters.  Comes in two flavors: group all
tweets, or group just tweets by a single user.

7. Follow/UnFollow users.

8. Open a hashtag in a browser.  If you see a few tweets
with `#interviewswithhari` and want to see more you can open
it up on the browser.  This is currently not supported as
viewing in emacs.

9. Open a user mention in the browser.  Same as 8, but for
user mentions in tweets.

Missing Features
----------------

Twitching does not provide a way to perform any of Twitter's
"social networking" features.

As is right now, there is no way to compose a tweet, reply
to a tweet or retweet.  Contributions to do the same are of
course welcome.  They aren't on the TODO list as of now.
