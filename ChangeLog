	v0.4.3

	* twitching.el: Bug fix in twitching-profile-get-image

	Bug fix to returning profile images.  In some cases,
	the function `twitching-profile-get-image' was
	returning :nil causing an error in
	`twitching-render-region'.

	* twitching.el: v0.4.2

	Bug fix to `twitching-profile-download-images'.  It
	was using the Emacs 24 version of `url-retrieve'
	that accepts a parameter SILENT.  This is not the
	case in Emacs 23.  The fix is to revert to using the
	Emacs 23 version of `url-retrieve'.

	* twitching.el: v0.4.1

	Bug fix to `twitching-profile-get-image'.  Was
	throwing an error when Emacs couldn't recognize the
	image file-type.  Specifically, in my case, Emacs
	didn't recognize the BMP format and the function
	`image-type' in image.el was throwing an error.

	Optimization: use a special variable :nil to
	indicate when an image has been downloaded but
	cannot be rendered by emacs.  This saves a file
	system lookup for each user profile image that has
	been downloaded but cannot be rendered by Emacs.

	* twitching.el: Version 0.4.0

	Implemented display of user profile images.

	Image display is disabled by default.  It can be
	enabled by setting the variable
	`*twitching-profile-use-p*' to t.

	* twitching.el: Implemented grouping of tweets by
	user mention also.

	Tweets of a particular user can be grouped into a
	separate buffer of their own.
