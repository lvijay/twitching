	* twitching.el: v0.4.1

	Bug fix to `twitching-profile-get-image'.  Was
	throwing an error when Emacs couldn't recognize the
	image file-type.  Specifically, in my case, Emacs
	didn't recognize the BMP format and the function
	`image-type' in image.el was throwing an error.

	Optimization: use a special variable :nil to
	indicate when an image has been downloaded but
	cannot be rendered by emacs.  This saves a file
	system lookup for each user profile image that has
	been downloaded but cannot be rendered by Emacs.

	* twitching.el: Version 0.4.0

	Implemented display of user profile images.

	Image display is disabled by default.  It can be
	enabled by setting the variable
	`*twitching-profile-use-p*' to t.

	* twitching.el: Implemented grouping of tweets by
	user mention also.

	Tweets of a particular user can be grouped into a
	separate buffer of their own.
