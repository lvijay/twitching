	point.

2011-08-24  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.6

2011-08-24  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.5

	* twitching.el (twitching-clear-old-tweets): added
	support to clear already read tweets.  Helps to keep
	the Twitching buffer small.

2011-08-23  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.4

	* twitching.el (twitching-profile-download-images):
	set coding-system-for-write to no-conversion when
	saving profile images also.

2011-08-22  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.3

	* twitching.el (url-http-handle-decompression):
	receiving gzipped responses was blowing up because
	the write-encoding was not set.  It has been
	explicitly set to `no-conversion' now.

2011-08-21  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.2

	* twitching.el (twitching-next-tweet): bugfix when
	point was in the middle of a tweet, next-tweet and
	prev-tweet would only move to the end/beginning of
	the tweet.

2011-08-21  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.1

	* twitching.el (twitching-copy-tweet-status-id):
	push the URL that represents the tweet into the
	kill-ring.  More meaningful when trying to open the
	tweet.

2011-08-20  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.7.0

	* twitching.el (url-http-handle-decompression):
	support for gzipped responses.

2011-08-06  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.6.0

	* twitching.el: refactored commands
	`twitching-to-get-my-tweets' and `twitching-stop' to
	`start-twitching' and `stop-twitching' respectively.

Tue Jul 12 23:51:33 2011  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.5.0

	* twitching.el: old look in new code.  Based upon
	feedback, reverted back to the display options as
	used in v0.4.2 but using the code refactorings that
	happened after.

2011-07-12  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.4.4

	* twitching.el: Improvements to image display.  Slice
	the image and show it on two lines if the tweet text
	spans more than one line.

	Sometimes there is a split in the images when this
	happens.  This may not be fixable as it depends upon
	Emacs's image rendering and the image size itself.

2011-07-11  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	v0.4.3

	* twitching.el: Bug fix in twitching-profile-get-image

	Bug fix to returning profile images.  In some cases,
	the function `twitching-profile-get-image' was
	returning :nil causing an error in
	`twitching-render-region'.

2011-07-11  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	* twitching.el: v0.4.2

	Bug fix to `twitching-profile-download-images'.  It
	was using the Emacs 24 version of `url-retrieve'
	that accepts a parameter SILENT.  This is not the
	case in Emacs 23.  The fix is to revert to using the
	Emacs 23 version of `url-retrieve'.

Sun Jul 10 14:03:59 2011  Vijay Lakshminarayanan  <laksvij@gmail.com>

	* twitching.el: v0.4.1

	Bug fix to `twitching-profile-get-image'.  Was
	throwing an error when Emacs couldn't recognize the
	image file-type.  Specifically, in my case, Emacs
	didn't recognize the BMP format and the function
	`image-type' in image.el was throwing an error.

	Optimization: use a special variable :nil to
	indicate when an image has been downloaded but
	cannot be rendered by emacs.  This saves a file
	system lookup for each user profile image that has
	been downloaded but cannot be rendered by Emacs.

2011-07-10    Vijay Lakshminarayanan <laksvij@gmail.com>

	* twitching.el: Version 0.4.0

	Implemented display of user profile images.

	Image display is disabled by default.  It can be
	enabled by setting the variable
	`*twitching-profile-use-p*' to t.

2011-07-10    Vijay Lakshminarayanan <laksvij@gmail.com>

	* twitching.el: Implemented grouping of tweets by
	user mention also.

	Tweets of a particular user can be grouped into a
	separate buffer of their own.
