1. Support more types of filters, such as:

  * Filters on regular expressions.

  * Composite filters.  

    For example, a filter on tweets from `@thedailybeast`
    that have the the hashtag `#cheatsheet`.

2. Actions

  Think of these as filters on steroids.  An _action_ is a
  function executed when a tweet matches some filter.

  For instance, if I'm very interested in tweets from
  [PTI](http://twitter.com/#!/PTI_News "Press Trust of
  India") that contain the word "`corruption`", I'd like to
  automatically favorite them so that I don't miss any.

  While this is easy to do programatically, the goal is to
  provide an interactive way to do all this.  Think of
  Microsoft Outlook's "Rules and Alerts" interface.

3. Async

  All of twitching's calls are synchronous.  The goal is to
  make all these calls asynchronous.  Technically, this
  shouldn't be too hard.  We are already using the url
  library's url-retrieve which provides an async interface.

4. Menus

  There's only a keyboard interface with all the keyboard
  shortcuts.  Providing clickable menus would help new users
  greatly.
