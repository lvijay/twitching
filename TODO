The below features should be read as a wishlist of where I
see twitching going.  The features are not ordered in any
way.

1. Support more types of filters, such as:

  * Filters on regular expressions.

  * Composite filters.  

    For example, a filter on tweets from `@thedailybeast`
    that have the the hashtag `#cheatsheet`.

2. Actions

  Think of these as filters on steroids.  An _action_ is a
  function executed when a tweet matches some filter.

  For instance, if I'm very interested in tweets from
  [PTI](http://twitter.com/#!/PTI_News "Press Trust of
  India") that contain the word "`corruption`", I'd like to
  automatically favorite them so that I don't miss any.

  While this is easy to do programatically, the goal is to
  provide an interactive way to do all this.  Think of
  Microsoft Outlook's "Rules and Alerts" interface.

3. Async

  All of twitching's calls are synchronous.  The goal is to
  make all these calls asynchronous.  Technically, this
  shouldn't be too hard.  We are already using the url
  library's url-retrieve which provides an async interface.

4. Menus

  There's only a keyboard interface with all the keyboard
  shortcuts.  Providing clickable menus would help new users
  greatly.

5. Persist tweets

  It would be useful to have tweets persisted and rolled
  over every day so that the `*twitching*` buffer doesn't
  bloat up in size.

  Twitching was written with this sort of a goal in mind,
  which is why the tweets written in the buffer are a string
  representation of the `twitching-status` object.  This
  way, tweets can be stored in text files and rendered as
  needed.

  The only pending task here is to actually write the buffer
  to a file and clear the buffer out periodically.

6. Manage people followed

  I often find myself going to twitter.com to review the
  people I follow and unfollow some of them.
